# Project 2 API

A template for starting projects with `rails-api`. Includes authentication.

At the beginning of each cohort, update the versions in [`Gemfile`](Gemfile).

## Dependencies

Install with `bundle install`.

-   [`rails-api`](https://github.com/rails-api/rails-api)
-   [`rails`](https://github.com/rails/rails)
-   [`active_model_serializers`](https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers)
-   [`ruby`](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
-   [`postgres`](http://www.postgresql.org)

Until Rails 5 is released, this template should follow the most recent released
version of Rails 4, as well as track `master` branches for `rails-api` and
`active_model_serializers`.
